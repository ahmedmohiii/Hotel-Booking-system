### A simple and interactive Java-based hotel booking system that allows users to:
* View Available Rooms (ID, type, price, capacity)
* Select Check-In and Check-Out Dates
* Book Rooms based on availability

### ðŸ›  Key Features
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX
* Exception Handling (e.g., date validation, booking errors)
* Sorting rooms by ID using Comparable and FXCollections.sort

### Object-Oriented Principles:
* Encapsulation: Data hidden with getters/setters
* Abstraction: Abstract room class as a blueprint
* Polymorphism: Multiple room types (Standard, Deluxe, Suite) treated as ARoom
